# shopping-cart-project

## Intro

This Shopping Cart project was created to let me crystalize all of the React knowledge I had learned up to this point in my mind. Completing allowed me to see how a frequently used system on thousands of websites across the web needed to function. Creating a version of it for myself allowed me to see the deeper nuances of its operation and taught me to use Reacts entire toolset to my advantage to achieve it.

While there is an overall simplicity in the websites layout, I was able to focus for on also expanding my CSS skills, as I took the approach of copying Koenigseggs website as closely as I could in design. It was a fun challenge and I very much enjoyed the project.
